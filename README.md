# Overview
Create a weather dashboard with form inputs.
When a user searches for a city they are presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
When a user views the current weather conditions for that city they are presented with:
-The city name
-The date
-An icon representation of weather conditions
-The temperature
-The humidity
-The wind speed
When a user view future weather conditions for that city they are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays:
-The date
-An icon representation of weather conditions
-The temperature
-The humidity

When a user click on a city in the search history they are again presented with current and future conditions for that city
I finished the challenge using jQuery and events around local storage.
